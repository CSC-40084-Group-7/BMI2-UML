Glossary

Event: The event that is happening, e.g. App Development in a mobile world.
Delegates: People attending the event, sometimes on behalf of a company.
Exhibitor: A person attending the event on behalf of their company. Each Exhibitor works at one stand.
Moderator: Works in the background during a session filtering the questions sent in by delegates, for the purpose of avoiding anything unsuitable being sent to the speaker, and amalgamating similar questions into one so as to avoid repeating the same question
Session: A talk or presentation happening at the event. Several of these can happen at the same time at larger events and delegates would have to choose which ones they want to attend.  Sometimes these can require a pre-registration of interest to allow entry.
Speaker: An individual presenting the session. These can be the same as exhibitors, or they may be completely independent.
Stand: One per company at the event. These companies are ones that have paid to have a stand at the event.  Often these will be sponsors of the event looking to sell some sort of software or service to the delegates.   Multiple Exhibitors may work on one stand though.
